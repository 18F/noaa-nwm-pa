# Problem statement

- A problem statement is a short, 2-3 sentence description of what problem weâ€™re trying to solve.
- You should be able to apply the 5 "W"s (Who, What, Where, When and Why) to the problem statement.
- It should not suggest a solution.
- We expect that the problem statement may evolve over the course of the next few weeks based on our learning.

At this point, we're using some problem statement phrases almost in a
_mad-lib_ format to help us think about whose problem we'll focus on during
our next stage; in the end, we'll need _you_ to generate the problem statement
for the user role most important to the OWP. Some of the problem statement
"atoms" that we have in mind are:
 

#### A [user role]

- Software engineers
- Hydrologists (vs atmospheric scientists)
- Emergency managers 
- Resident of flood plain / floodcast forecast consumer

#### Who feels [negative feeling]

- Confounded
- Isolated
- Limited 
- Uncertain

#### About [reason]

- The code
- The forecast
- The regional representations
- The lack of community

#### Needs to [step]

- Decide where to stage rescue operations
- Find people working on similar hydrologic/computational problems
- Model groundwater for regional Kentucky limestone karst

#### But faces [obstacle]

- A months-long learning curve 
- A year of software engineering without delivering value
- Doubts about the accuracy of flood forecast
- No framework for regional variations
- 

### Sample problem statements


* A software engineer who feels confounded about the code, needs to model
  groundwater for regional Kentucky limestone karst, but faces a year of
  software engineering without delivering value.
* A hydrologist who feels isolated about the lack of community, needs to find people
  working on similar hydrologic/computational problems, but faces a
  months-long learning curve
