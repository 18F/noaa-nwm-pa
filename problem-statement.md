# Problem statement

- A problem statement is a short, 2-3 sentence description of what problem weâ€™re trying to solve.
- You should be able to apply the 5 "W"s (Who, What, Where, When and Why) to the problem statement.
- It should not suggest a solution.
- We expect that the problem statement may evolve over the course of the next few weeks based on our learning.
