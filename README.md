## National Water Model - 18F Path Analysis

18F is partnering with the NOAA Office of Water Prediction
an 8 week path analysis (PA) focused on understanding 
the current and future needs of the [National Water Model](https://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm).

The National Water Model is in its infancy — it’s just celebrated its third birthday, and yet it is experiencing challenges — most namely that the current architecture limits scientific development and improvement in forecast skill.

The challenge is not solving the problem of better representation of the environment (that will come later) — but rather taking lessons from the current implementation and building an infrastructure that meets our minimum requirements for success, is capable of being evolved, and is accompanied by a process that effectively governs the evolution in an effective and efficient manner.

There are 24 federal agencies with their hands in water, and there is interest and enthusiasm from the wider community in improving water modeling. This project was undertaken with an eye on this wider community and the wider group of federal agencies — to engage through the planning and implementation of foundation development, scientific model development, and maintainance, encouraging persistent innovation between agencies and the public.

The path forward for the next generation NWM is an emergent architecture, developed by software engineers while continually checked and co-developed upon by scientific specialists, in the open. 

Ideally, the technology choices made in the next generation NWM would be exciting to the community and optimized for the research to operations pipeline. Without the community component to this project, efforts across government will be duplicative and competitive rather than collaborative. 

This path forward acknowledges that to be successful, the NWM must:

- develop and engage a wider community from agencies and the public, 
- rely on scientific specialists for science and software specialists for software, and 
- be optimized for changes 
  - in requirements as new models are developed, and 
  - in runtime environments as the supercomputing landscape changes.
  
To that end, 18F will focus our efforts on assisting OWP in kicking off and preparing for the longer-term development of this wider community effort to reimplement the NWM by:

- Developing in-house product owners and technical leads, to enable monitoring performance of an agile team through a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan
- Preparing OWP to lead a community effort by examining what has been successful for other similar-scale projects and identifying key success factors
- Identifying ideal skills for a software team by researching what technology choices have been practical and useful in other large-scale modeling projects
- Evaluating deployment strategies for launching a next generation National Water Model to determine ways to mitigate the risk of a cutover deployment
- Identifying key vendors who 18F or its partners have previously worked with for providing software development scrum teams
- Determining strategies for effectively breaking apart and collaborating on tasks along scientific and software boundaries with the expectation of a future team being split between scientific specialists and software specialists
