# Physics

A software architecture that allows for application of scale- and regime-aware physics will enable more accurate streamflow prediction.

# Computing environment 

A well-engineered architecture that can run in multiple environments will enable community development, and a broader and more dynamic application of the model. 

# Community 

The NWM must be understandable and approachable, with code structure following a deliberate and logical design pattern.

Contributions to the NWM must be recognized as significant to the community.

# Technology 
Standardizing interfaces is key to providing a useful community model infrastructure. 

# Organizational & team structure 

Cross-functional mission-driven teams organized around outcomes, and teams where scientists and software engineers work together have been identified as keys to success. 

# Pipeline impact 

Operationalizing research code places barriers to entry for new ideas. Identifying and reducing the impact of barriers to community collaboration on the research-to-operations pipeline is key to maintaining flexibility.
